Venue Structure Change Detection Module

This module handles the detection of venue seat structure changes, specifically
transitions between 'odd_even' and 'consecutive' seating arrangements.

Business Requirements:
- When a venue's seating structure changes (odd_even â†” consecutive), all active
  seat packs across all performances for that venue must be delisted
- New seat packs must be generated based on the new structure
- Changes must be tracked with appropriate audit trails

Technical Approach:
- Compare current seat_structure with previous_seat_structure field
- Detect meaningful changes that affect seat pack generation
- Provide structured data for downstream processing

Author: Claude Code Assistant
Purpose: Automated detection of venue seat structure changes to trigger seat pack synchronization
